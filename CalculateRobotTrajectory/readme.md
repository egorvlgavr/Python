# Program to calculate robot trajectory
## Description
This program calculate trajectory of manipulator of three-link planar arm. As initial condition we have four points and four moments of time, when manipulator is at these points. We consider that manipulator moves on 4-3-4 trajectory. Program draw trajectory in XYZ coordinates and it projections in XY, XZ, YZ planes. 
## Information
This program is written on *Python 3.5*. It use **numpy** for matrix operations and **matplotlib** for visualisation of data.
